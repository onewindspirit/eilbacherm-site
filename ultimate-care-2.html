            <p>The source of 'Ultimate Care II' is the household washing machine of Matmos, Whirlpool's 'top loading, high efficiency washing system, with easy to use consoles, making it simple to select the wash/spin speed combination for each load.' The entire album was sourced by the duo's capturing, cutting, and manipulation of the sounds generated from the machine, allowing the sounds to have their own existence. The video echos this process, separating the machine from it's intended domestic position. An animated model of a washing machine is often shown as isolated, orbiting in a screen of black, while undergoing material transformation- it is a visual equivalency to acousmatic sound. The hard, white facade of the machine undergoes a material change, warping, melting, and bending at the inclination of body parts, bodies at work, captured from washing machine pornography. The domestic is work, just as sex is work, all inclusive in the industry of sterility.</p>
